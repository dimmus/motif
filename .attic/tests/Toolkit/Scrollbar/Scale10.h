1) A client with two Scales and four PushButtons contained\n\
   in a Bulletin Board should appear.  The horizontal scale\n\
   is 375 pixels wide and 30 pixels high and has an initial\n\
   value of 44.  The vertical scale is 30 pixels wide and 375\n\
   pixels high and has an initial value of 66.\n\
2) Throughout all of the following operations, the value label\n\
   for each scale widget should remain directly above (horizontal\n\
   scale) or to the left (vertical scale) of the slider.\n\
3) Click MB1 in the PushButton labeled \"Horiz scaleHeight to 50\".\n\
   The horizontal scale should grow to a scaleHeight of 50.\n\
4) Click MB1 in the PushButton labeled \"Vert scaleHeight to 50\".\n\
   The vertical scale should shrink to a scaleHeight of 50.\n\
5) Click MB1 in the PushButton labeled \"Horiz scaleWidth to 50\".\n\
   The horizontal scale should shrink to a scaleWidth of 50.\n\
6) Click MB1 in the PushButton labeled \"Vert scaleWidth to 50\".\n\
   The vertical scale should grow to a scaleWidth of 50.\n\
7) Move the horizontal scale slider several times and look at the\n\
   values printed in the stdout window.  The old and new values\n\
   should reflect the direction and amount of movement.\n\
8) Click MB1 on the slider of the horizontal scale without\n\
   moving it.  The old and new values printed should be the same.\n\
9) Test Finished -- Exit Please"
