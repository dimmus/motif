#) A new scrollbar is created with orientation set to VERTICAL.  The slider
should be in its default position at the top (value=0, 
processingDirection=MAX_ON_BOTTOM).
C)
#) The processing direction is set to
MAX_ON_TOP.  The slider should have shifted all the way to the bottom.
C)
#) The orientation is set to HORIZONTAL.  The slider should be in its 
shifted position at the right (value=0, processingDirection=MAX_ON_LEFT -
which corresponds to MAX_ON_TOP).
C)
#) The processing direction is set to MAX_ON_RIGHT.  The slider should
have shifted to the far left end.
