 * HISTORY
 */

#) A client window will appear containing a label widget. 
#) Move the pointer into the client window and press MB3.  A
   PopupMenu will appear.
#) Verify that the PopupMenu behaves correctly for right to left
   layout.  The PopupMenu should be positioned with its upper 
   right corner at the point of selection. 
#) Drag the pointer down through the PopupMenu.
   You will notice the following behavior:
   - Each time the pointer passes into a Pushbutton widget, a
     message indicating that the widget's arm callback has been
     called will be displayed in the xterm window.
   - Each time the pointer passes out of a Pushbutton widget, a
     message indicating that the widget's disarm callback has been
     called will be displayed in the xterm window.
   - Each time the pointer passes into a CascadeButton widget, a
     message indicating that the widget's cascade callback has been
     called will be displayed in the xterm window. 
#) Drag the pointer to the top of the PopupMenu.  Release MB3.
   The PopupMenu will disappear.
