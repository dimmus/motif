#) A client window containing a Form widget with nine OptionMenu
   children will appear.  The window will be located 350 pixels down
   from the top left corner of the display.  Click on the buttons
   labeled 'Himalayan', 'Siamese', and 'E. Shorthair' and
   you'll see the same (shared) menu pane.
      Note: there should be no warning messages in the xterm window. 
#) Move the pointer into the client window.  Traverse from button to
   button using the down arrow key.  The focus should move through
   the buttons in the following order:
      Himalayan, Siamese, D. Shorthair
      Maine Cat, Burmese, E. Shorthair,
      Turkish Van,  Persian,
      Russian Blue.

#) The client window will now contain 3 OptionMenu children.
   The three OptionMenu children share the same PulldownMenu.  OptionMenu1
   sets XmNmenuHistory to Button1, OptionMenu2 sets XmNmenuHistory to
   Button3, and OptionMenu3 sets XmNmenuHistory to Button2. 
#) Verify the defaults are set correctly.

   selection area should be initialized to A Long Item.

   to the right of the A Long Item label.

   appear that contains one OptionMenu child.
