#) A client window containing a RowColumn widget with nine OptionMenu
   children will appear.  The window will be located 300 pixels down
   from the top left corner of the display.  Click on the buttons
   labelled 'Himalayan', 'Siamese', and 'Exotic Shorthair' and
   you'll see the same (shared) menu pane.
      Note: there should be no warning messages in the xterm window. 
#) When you select one of the choices in any shared menu, the shadow
   of its corresponding CascadeButton will increase.  Also, the font
   of the label will change to '8x13bold', a larger, bold font. 
#) Verify the graphic to the right of the text is the same in each
   Option Button. It should be a small, shadowed square
   (example: the button next to \"Domestic Shorthair\". 
#) Use the up and down arrow keys to traverse between the OptionMenus. You 
should go up and down within the columns.
#) Use the left and right arrow keys to traverse across the rows.
C)

#) An option menu in a row column should appear with three push buttons.
#) Press MB1 on the option menu selection area.  Move the pointer to item1
   and release.

#) Click MB1 on LARGER. This will make the size of the push button bigger, 
	as well as its parent, the rowcolumn.
#) Select item1 from the option menu again.  The rowcolumn should not change
   size.

C)

#) Two option menus should appear.  Verify that both option menus
   can be selected.   Each has 3 entries.
#) Be sure that clicking MB1 in the selection area of the option menu
   posts the menu.
C)

#) The height of the button gadget in the first option menu has been changed 
   to 80.  Verify that the height appears correct and that each option menu
   can be selected and displays their three entries correctly.
E)
