#) A main window with a menubar appears with two pulldown menus.  
#) No warnings should have appeared on the term window. If you get a 
   warning which says:
      Name: pb24
      Class: XmPushButton
      Illegal mnemonic character;  Could not convert X KEYSYM to a keycode
   then, CR 5201 hasn't been fixed.
#) Verify that PIR 1851 works "If a menu mnemonic is the same as the mnemonic
   of the posting cascade button, the post gets cancelled", by pressing
   KMenuBar to get focus to the menubar. Then type 's'.  The pulldown
   menu 'Stuff' should post.
#) Now type 's' again.  Pulldown menu item 'something' should be selected.
   To verify this, "Doin Something" should appear in the xterm window.
C)

#) Verify that multiple accelerator modifiers work correctly.  Pulldown
   Stuff has two pushbuttons which have multiple modifiers.  With the
   focus in the window, type <Ctrl><Shift>s.  'Doin Something' should
   appear in the term window.
#) Type <Shift><Ctrl>n.  'Doin Nothing' should appear in the term window.
C)

#) Verify that focus appears correctly in pulldown menus which have one
   entry.  Use KMenuBar to get focus to the menubar.  Type KRight to
   move focus to 'Stuff'.  Type KDown to post the Pulldown menu.  Focus
   (highlight) should appear on the 'Nothing' pulldown menu.  Now type KLeft 
   to move focus to the pulldown menu Commands.  Focus should appear around
   'Exit'.  
#) Type KRight to move focus back to the other pulldown menu.  'Nothing'
   should be highlighted.
#) Type KCancel to unpost the menu.
