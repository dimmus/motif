#) A simple File Selection Box is created. The directory list should
   contain two items and the Files list should contain multiple file
   names.
#) The purpose of this test is to modify the FileSelectionBox programatically
#) The next step will add a Work area which will be a Text widget. The
   text widget will contain the string \"Some Text.\"
C)
#) The Text widget work area should have been added.
#) The next step will unmanage the Files label and list. This will
   cause the FileSelectionBox to expand and the full Directory list
   should be visible.
C)
#) The FileSelectionBox minus the Files label and list should be visible.
#) The next step will unmanage the Directories label and list. This will
   cause the FileSelectionBox to expand and the full Files list
   should be visible. The Files list and label will be managed again.
C)
#) The FileSelectionBox minus the Directories label and list should be visible.
#) The next step will unmap the Files list. The Directories label and list
   will be managed again.
C)
#) The FileSelectionBox minus the File list should be visible.
#) The next step should remap the Files list.
C)
#) The full FileSelectionBox should be visible.
#) The next step should redefine a new DirSearchProc this should change the
   Directories list to contain the strings Hello, this, is, a, new, dir,
   search, proc. The directories label string should change to 
   \"A very very long label\".
C)
#) The full FileSelectionBox with the modified Directories list should be
   visible.
#) The next step should redefine a new FileSearchProc this should change the
   Files list to contain the strings Hello, this, is, a, new, file, search,
   proc. The Files label string will change to 
   \"A Very Long Label for test purposes\".
C)
#) The full FileSelectionBox with the modified Files list should be visible.
#) The next step should reset the DirSearchProc and the FileSearchProc 
   back to default values. The FileSelectionBox should look as it did in 
   the first step (except for the directory and file list label strings).
C)
#) The full FileSelectionBox should be visible. The Directories and Files
   list should be the same as when the widget was first displayed (except for
   the directory and file list label strings).
E)
