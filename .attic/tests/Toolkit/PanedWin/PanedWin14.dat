#) Buttons 1 and 2 are 150 in height, Button 3 is 80. Pane minimum
   is 100. Try to resize panes smaller than their mimimum. 
#) Press Alt-F8 (or pull down Size from the client's
   window menu) and take note of the current height of the client. 
C)

#) Minimums for each pane now set at their current size. You should
   not be able to make any pane smaller.
   Because the Paned Window's top and bottom margins were increased,
   the Pane and Shell should grow by about 100 pixels to
   accomodate the mimimums and margins. 
#) Again take note of the current height of the client. 
C)

#) The sashes are doubled in size. Should be a net gain of about 22 pixels in
   the size of the shell. 
C)

#) The separators should disappear. The sash is now as wide as the
   Paned Window, making a sort of bar where the
   separator and sash were. The children remain the same, except the minimum
   size for each has been reduced by 50 so the sashes can be moved.  
C)
A manager is added.
C)
Now a scrolled text widget.
C)
And another one with resizeHeight = False
E)
