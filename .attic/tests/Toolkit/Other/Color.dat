#) This test should be run on a monochrome display. 
#) A Form containing a PushButton named "bye" should have appeared on your 
   screen.
#) If you click on "bye", the application context will be destroyed. This
   means that both the window containing the PushButton, and the instruction
   box will disappear. The test will then exit. No fatal errors should occur
   after you click on the PushButton.
#) Click on the PushButton.
