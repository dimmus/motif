/* Test PIR4340 */
#) A client containing a MessageBox Dialog should appear. The MessageBox
   should have a messageString of \"DialogStyle Unmanaged Test\", the OK 
   button should have a label of \"UnManage\". The dialogStyle will be
   XmDIALOG_SYSTEM_MODAL, which will cause the cursor's symbol to change
   and will disallow input (including focus) in any window on your 
   system other than the Message Dialog.

#) Press MB1 on the Unmanage button of the dialog. The Message Dialog 
   should be Unmanaged and should \"pop down\". You now should be able to
   have focus in any window and the cursor should change back to the 
   default cursor.

   stacked on top of each other in the left corner

#) Both "FormDialog1" and "FormDialog2" windows should disappear.

#) Both "FormDialog1" and "FormDialog2" windows should reappear.

#) If only "FormDialog1" reappears, then PIR3006 has not been fixed.
   Click MouseBtn1 on "Post FormDialog2". You should see the message
   "FormDialog2 already managed" on the term window.

/* Test CR5043 */

#) If, after clicking on MouseBtn1, "FormDialog2" reappears and the 
   message "FormDialog2 being managed" on the term window, the PIR5043 
   has been fixed.
