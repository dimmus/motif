#) A client with arrow button pointing upwards should appear. 
#) Two messages should be printed in term window. The first says that
   the unitType is inches (1000TH_INCHES) and the size is set at 2000x1000.
   The next line prints out the width and height. These
   values are returned by XtGetValues. The width and height should be
   approximately, but not exactly, the same as the values in the first line. 
   This is because there is a rounding difference when converting 
   1000TH_INCHES to pixels. 
C)

#) The arrow button should change size 4 times. 
#) Each time, the Expected and the Returned sizes should be printed in the 
   term window. The Expected values are those used in XtSetValues 
   and the Returned values are those retured by XtGetValues. The Returned 
   values should be approximately equal to the Expected values.  This is 
   because there is a rounding difference when converting 1000TH_INCHES 
   to pixels. 
C)

#) A message should be printed in the term window saying that unit type
   is being set to millimeters (100TH_MILLIMETERS). 
#) The arrow button should change size 4 times. 
#) Each time, the Expected and the Returned sizes should be printed in 
   the term window. The Expected values are those used in XtSetValues 
   and the Returned values are those returned by XtGetValues. The Returned
   values should be approximately equal to the Expected values.  This is 
   because there is a rounding difference when   
   converting 100TH_MILLIMETERS to pixels. 
C)

#) A arrow button should change size to 2000 x 1000. 
#) Two messages should be printed in term window. The first says that
   the size is set at 2000x1000. The next line is again the width and
   height printed out. These values are returned by XtGetValues. The
   width and height should be approximately 2000 by 1000.
   This is because there is a rounding difference when
   converting 100TH_MILLIMETERS to pixels.
