#) A ComboBox of the type COMBO_BOX is displayed. This type of ComboBox
   always displays its list. Verify that a List is displayed with 20 
   visible items.
#) The spacing between list items should be 5.
#) The height and width of the margin between the list border and the 
   items should be 2.
#) Click on the second item in the List. That item should be displayed in
   the text entry field.
C)


#) The cursor of the TextField widget should be at position 5.
#) Try typing into the TextField widget. 
#) The margin height and margin width should both be 20. (space between the
   4 sides of the window and the text).
#) As you keep typing, the TextField widget should grow horizontally to
   accomodate the text.
C)

#) A new item, "ExtraItem" should have been added to the end of the List.
#) Scroll down to the end of the List to verify that this is the
   last item.
#) Click MB1 on the last item.  Verify that the Text Field is updated
   with "ExtraItem".
  
C)

#) This panel tests the XmComboBoxUpdate function.
#) The selected item should change to be "Item1", and this is
   the item that should be displayed in the edit box.  "Item1" has been
   selected using XmListSelectionItem, and XmComboBoxUpdate should
   bring the ComboBox in sync with the new selected item.
#) Scroll upwards in the List to verify that "Item1" is selected in the List.
