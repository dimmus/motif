 * HISTORY
 */

#) This is a simple test of toggle button behaviors. To toggle a 
   toggle button, click anywhere on the label or on the indicator.  

#) Click on ToggleButton1. The indicator should fill to show it is on.
   Toggle Button 1 uses a large font and its indicator is sized 
   proportionally. 

#) Press MB1 down on ToggleButton1, then move outside the window and release
   the button.  The toggle indicator will change when you press the button
   and should revert when you move outside the window. 

#) Move the pointer back over ToggleButton1, and use the space bar to
   toggle the indicator. 


C)

#) Move the pointer over ToggleButton2. Toggle the toggle button using either 
   the mouse or the keyboard, as you did with ToggleButton1. The indicator 
   should not fill with a new color, but the top and bottom shadows should
   change.

#) Leave this button ON before you continue. It should remain ON for the
   remainder of the test. 


C)

#) ToggleButton3 should show no indicator. Toggle it, and the indicator will
   appear. 


C)

#) ToggleButton4 should already appear ON. You can manipulate it normally. 

#) ToggleButton5 contains a pixmap instead of a label. When you toggle the
   toggle button, the pixmap will change. 


C)

#) ToggleButton6 has no indicator. When you toggle it, the shadows should
   change so that it appears depressed. Press again and it will revert. 


C)

#) ToggleButton5 should now be toggled to the ON position (smiley face). 


C)

#) ToggleButton5 should now be toggled to the OFF position (circles). 


C)


#) The background of ToggleButton5 should have changed to smily face pixmap.


C)


#) The background of ToggleButton5 should have changed back to the default
   background color. 

#) PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE CONTINUING. In the next panel, the background
   of Manager is being specified as None. This may result in a X Protocol
   error.


C)

#) The background of Manager has been specified as None. This should not
   result in protocol error.
