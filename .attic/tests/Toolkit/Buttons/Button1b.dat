#) This test ensures that the ArrowButton, PushButton, and ToggleButton
   correctly change visually and stay in the correct state after calls
   to the widgets' action procs.
#) The instructions that follow assume you are running with a keyboardFocus
Policy (not Window Manager Focus) of XmEXPLICIT. If you are running in 
XmPOINTER focus policy, the instructions are not applicible.
#) A window with an ArrowButton, a PushButton and a ToggleButton should
   be visible.  They should be in a 'disarmed' state.
C)
#) The buttons should be armed.
#) From the right hand side of the window, move the pointer in to and out of
each widget in turn: Arrow, PushButton, then ToggleButton. There should be
NO change when the pointer moves in, but when the pointer moves out of the
widget, it should disarm.
C)
#) Pass the pointer over all the clients in the test. They should not change
state.
