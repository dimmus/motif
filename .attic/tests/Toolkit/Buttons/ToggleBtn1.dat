#) This is a simple test of toggle button behaviors. To toggle a 
   toggle button, click anywhere on the label or on the indicator.  
#) Click on Toggle1. The indicator should fill to show it is on.
   Three callback messages appeared in the xterm window: Arm, Value Changed, 
   and Disarm.  Toggle Button 1 uses a large font and its indicator is 
   sized proportionally. 
#) Press MB1 down on Toggle1, then move outside the window and release
   the button.
   You should get Arm and Disarm callback messages. The toggle indicator
   will change when you press the button and should revert when you move
   outside the window. 
#) Move the pointer back over Toggle1, and use the space bar to toggle 
   the indicator. 
C)

#) Move the pointer over Toggle2. Toggle the toggle button using either 
   the mouse or the keyboard, as you did with Toggle1. The indicator 
   should not fill with a new color, but the top and bottom shadows 
   should change 

#) Leave this button ON before you continue
   It should remain highlighted for the remainder of the test. 
C)

#) Toggle3 should show no indicator. Toggle it, and the indicator will appear. 
C)

#) Toggle4 should already appear ON. You can manipulate it normally. 

#) Toggle5 contains a pixmap instead of a label. When you toggle the
   toggle button, the pixmap will change. 
C)

#) Toggle6 has no indicator. When you toggle it, the shadows should change 
   so that it appears depressed. Press again and it will revert. 

C)
#) Toggle5 should now be toggled to the ON position (smiley face). 
C)
#) Toggle5 should now be toggled to the OFF position (circles).
