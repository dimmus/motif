	This is a simple test of traversal behaviors.  The two boxed groups of widgets are tab groups. You can move
   between the groups by pressing TAB or Shift-TAB. Within each group, move between the buttons by using the up and
   down arrow keys. Use the space key to activate (depress)
   the buttons. Try moving amongst the buttons and back and forth
   between the tab groups. 
C)
	Using the up and down arrow keys, move to the button labeled
\"arrow2\".  The button should now have the highlight around it.
Press return, and this pushbutton will become unmanaged and the
highlight should move to the button labelled \"arrow3\".
Now move up to the button labelled \"arrow1\" and press return.
The \"arrow2\" button will be managed and visible again, but the
highlight should remain around \"arrow1\".
