/*  CR 5303  */

#) A bulletin board containing 4 toggle buttons is created.  The initial
   spacing (XmNspacing) is set to 4.  The purpose of the test is to make
   sure that reducing and increasing the spacing works.  This tests CR5303.

#) First click MB1 on ToggleButton1.  The spacing should increase to 50.
   The spacing value for each button is printed on the calling xterm.

#) Next click on MB1 ToggleButton2.  The spacing should DECREASE to 5.
   The spacing value for each button is printed on the calling xterm.   

#) Next click on MB1 ToggleButton3.  The spacing should increase to 100.
   The spacing value for each button is printed on the calling xterm.

#) Finally, click MB1 on ToggleButton4.  The spacing should DECREASE to 75.
   The spacing value for each button is printed on the calling xterm.

/*  CR 5163  */

#) A bulletin board containg 6 children is created, 1 ToggleButton, one
   Lable, and 4 PushButtons.  They are arranged in two rows of three.
   The top row contains the Toggle, Lable and one Pushbutton.  Clicking
   MB1 on the corresponding PushButton below will change the XmNy resource
   and move the children below the 'Move' PushButtons.  The children
   should NOT change size.  This test corresponds to CR 5163 (ToggleButton
   resizes to minimum when changing any resource).

#) First click MB1 on "Move TglBtn1".  The "ToggleButton1" child should
   move below the "Move TglBtn1" PushButton but should NOT change size.

#) Next, click MB1 on "Move PushBtn1".  The "PushButton1" child should
   move below the "Move PushBtn" PushButton but should NOT change size.

#) Finally, click MB1 on "Move Lbl1".  The "Lable1" child should
   move below the "Move Lbl1" PushButton but should NOT change size.
