#) A client with an information dialog should appear. The
   dialog will have three buttons labeled 'Minimize',
   'W=500', and 'H=300'. The 'W=500' button should have highlight. 
#) Move the pointer into the dialog, you should get a focusCallback
   message in the term window.
#) Move outside the window again and now move back into the dialog very
   quickly. You should NOT get multiple focusCallbacks, you should only
   get one.

   initially move into the dialog you should NOT get a focusCallback
   (the window should not have window manager focus).
