/* CASE 1 */
#) A 1.1 Paned Window with buttons. Depress each button
   using the space key. Focus should go to   sash after each button.
#) Move any sash with the up or down
   arrow keys. If you hold down the key, the sash will cause
   other sashes to move with it as it reaches them.
C)
/* CASE 2 */
#) A 1.0 Paned Window with buttons. Focus should go to
   next button in the paned window. 
#) Tab should take you between the Paned Window and the PushButtons
in the Row Column.
#) Make every button insensitive,
   then resize slightly to see everything. Note carefully
   where the focus goes after each button is un-sensitized.
C)
/* CASE 2a */
@) A 1.1 Paned Window with EXCLUSIVE_TAB_GROUP manager children.
#) Use the Tab key to move the focus from one tab group to another,
and the arrow keys to move between the children in the row columns.
#) You should not tab to the sash.
C)
/* Case 3 */
#) A 1.1 Paned Window in a Form parent. Make sure space
   activates the buttons.
#) The Tab key should take you to all the panes and to the Row Column.
C)
/* Case 4 */
#) A 1.0 Paned Window in a Form parent. Make sure space
   activates the buttons.
#) The Tab key should take you back and forth between the Paned Window
and the Row Column.
C)
/* Case 5 */
#) A RowColumn. Focus should start on button1, and move to the next button
   as each becomes insensitive. Use the space key to make buttons insensitive.
C)
/* Case 6 */
#) The RowColumn's children were destroyed and recreated. Focus should appear
on a button as soon as you give the window focus. Move among the buttons and
make them insensitive.
C)
/* Case 7 */
#) The RowColumn's children were destroyed and recreated. Focus should appear
on a button as soon as you give the window focus. Now, pressing a button will
change its label but not make it insensitive. Traverse around using arrow
keys and make sure highlight moves properly.
