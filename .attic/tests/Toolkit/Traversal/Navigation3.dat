!) This is a test of traversal behaviors.  
#) We used XmAddTabGroup to add five simple widgets to the TAB list.
#) The widgets that have been specified as Tab groups are those with a red
background. You should move between these widgets when you press the Tab or
Shift-Tab key. 
The reason there are six instead of five is because all the
non-specified buttons are grouped into one tab group automatically by the
toolkit.
#) The labels of the red (tabbable) buttons indicate the order in which
they should be traversed.
#) The up and down arrow keys should only move the focus among the buttons 
in the first tab group.
#) Use the space key to activate (depress) the buttons. 
#) Try moving amongst the buttons and back and forth between the tab groups.
#) Click MB1 on any other (non-red) button. The location cursor (focus)
 should not move between the red buttons.
