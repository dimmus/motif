the password for Text1, the test will keep resetting the focus to Text1.
C)
#) The password is "meow".  Enter the password and press Tab.  The focus moves to the next text widget.

#) Type "insensitive" into Text1 and hit tab. The widget becomes insensitive and the
focus moves to the next text widget.

#) Give the client window focus by clicking on the empty area below the
empty frames and the text widgets.
#) You should see only one active, blinking insertion cursor. The other text
widget should have a stippled insertion cursor which does not blink.
#) Click in the second text widget.
#) Click in the first text widget.
#) An error dialog should appear.
#) Unmanage the dialog. There should be only one text insertion cursor.

#) Put the focus back into Text1.
#) Click MB1 in Text2.
#) Each time you try to put the focus into one of the other text widgets, it should set the focus back to Text1. If it cannot, it will issue a warning message.
#) Click rapidly in different text widgets. Make sure the location cursor and the insertion cursor stay together.
#) Try typing into the widgets as you click in them. Make sure the text goes where the insertion cursor and the location cursor are. At no point should you see multiple insertion cursors.
