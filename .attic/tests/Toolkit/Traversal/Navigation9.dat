!) This is a simple test of traversal behaviors.  
#) The five boxed groups of widgets are tab groups. 
#) Put the focus on the test client by clicking on the window border.
#) The button which is colored red should also have the focus and
location cursor, as well as the default highlight.
C)
#) You can move between the groups by hitting TAB or Shift-TAB. 
#) Each time you tab into the frame with the red button, the focus
should go to that button, even if you use the arrow keys to move
within that tab group.
#) Within each group, move between the buttons by using the up/down and 
left/right arrow keys. 
#) Use the space key to activate (depress) the buttons. 
#) Try moving amongst the buttons and back and forth between the tab groups. 
#) The default button is btn1. When the focus is on a push button, that
button will have the defaultButton shadow as well. But when the focus is
moved to a non-push button, the defaultButton shadow moves back to btn1.
#) Before continuing, put the focus on misc1.
C)
#) The red button has been set insensitive. Tab into that group.
#) The focus should go to 3btn1.
#) Before continuing, note which widget has the focus.
C)
#) A prompt dialog appears.
#) Give the prompt dialog window the focus.
#) The focus should be on the OK button
#) Dismiss the prompt dialog by hitting return.
#) Put the focus on the client window. The focus should be on the
widget that had the focus before the prompt dialog came up.
#) Tab through all the tab groups and back to the one with the red button.
The focus should go to the red button when you tab into that group.
