 * HISTORY
 */

#) Testing the XmNinitialFocus resource of a DrawingArea.

#) You should see a Form with two DrawingArea children separated by
   a seperator.  The topmost DrawingArea has two children both of
   which are TextFields.

C)

#) XmNinitialFocus set to NULL for both DrawingAreas.

#) Use the KTab key to traverse around the form.

#) You should see messages printed to stdout that indicate the focus is
   being registered by the two TextFields and DrawingArea 2 (the one on
   the bottom.)

C)

#) XmNinitialFocus set to non-NULL for both DrawingAreas.

#) Use the KTab key to traverse around the form.

#) You should see messages printed to stdout that indicate the focus is
   being registered only by the two DrawingAreas.  The Focus should not
   go to either of the TextFields.

E)
