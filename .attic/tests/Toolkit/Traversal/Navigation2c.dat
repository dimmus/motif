#) This is a test of traversal behaviours.  Nine Row Columns should appear within a Form. Each Row Column is a 3x3 matrix of PushButtons. 
#) Pressing the TAB or Shift-TAB will result on the focus moving 
from one RowColumn to another. 
#) Pressing the up/down left/right arrow keys will result in traversal 
within the current row column. 
#) Clicking MB1 on the PushButtons should make them disappear.
#) Each time a button is removed, the remaining buttons will rearrange themselves and the focus should remain in the same location, though on a different button.
#) There should always be one button with the focus highlight.
#) Click MB1 
on the PushButtons of any of the RowColumns until they are all gone.
#) The focus should move to the first button in the next tab group.
