@) A client window with a DrawnButton should appear.
   The Button will contain a "DONT PANIC" Pixmap, but with the thick
   shadows within the window
   the client window should not be large enough to completely display the
   pixmap; the window 
   will instead display the shadow very close up so that it appears
   as two shaded triangles abutting one another.
#) Confirm that the shadows and a part of the "DONT PANIC" pixmap
   (letters NT and parts of NIC letters) are displayed.

C)

#) Resize the window larger in several increments. Confirm that as it
grows the shadow thickness remains a constant size. As the window grows
larger, the pixmap with a superimposed label should appear. Continue
until the label is fully visible.


E)
