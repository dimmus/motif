@) This test is used to exercise the user-level implementation of the
text widgets.  Below is a list of all the keyboard/mouse bindings
and their expected actions.  Try each one on all four flavors of
text widgets and in both add mode and normal mode on each.
#) Scrolling:

@)    KPageUp      -- pages up
@)    KPageDown    -- pages down
@)    KPageLeft    -- pages left
@)    KPageRight   -- pages right
 
#) With MB1 (primary selection) or Alt-MB2 (secondary selection) pressed,
moving the pointer beyond the list should
scroll the text in that direction.
