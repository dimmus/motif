 * HISTORY
 */
#) This test should have been run with the flag "-u 3".
#) A Notebook will appear on your screen. All resources for this Notebook 
   have been set via the defaults file Notebook.defaults.  
   There will also be a control panel with which you can do a GetValues on
   those resources of the Notebook that are of type Dimension. (Since it
   may be hard to visually gauge what values these resources have been
   set to).
#) The width and height of Page 1 of the Notebook have been set to 400. This
   should be reflected in the size of the Notebook. The actual width
   and height will be roughly 550.
#) The Notebook should have horizontal orientation. 
#) The placement of the back pages of the Notebook should be bottom right.
#) The Notebook should have a spiral binding.
