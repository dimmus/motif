/*
 * HISTORY
 */

#) A Container will appear empty.
#) It has been created only with defaults, so layoutType is Spatial,
   spatialStyle is XmGRID, viewType is ANY_ICON, and spatialResizeModel
   is GROW_MINOR.
#) A margin width of 20 has been set.
C)

#) 10 Icon Gadgets are added to the Container.
#) The Container is only growing vertically, so all the icon gadgets
   should be in one column.
#) "IconGad0", "IconGad1", "IconGad3", "IconGad4" and "IconGad9" are
   displayed in their large icon view. The other ones are displayed in 
   their small icon view.
C)

#) The spatialStyle is now set to XmNONE.
#) No change should be noticed.
C)

#) The Icon gadgets are unmanaged, the spatialResizeModel is set to
   XmGROW_BALANCED.
#) The Icon gadgets are managed again. The layout should be balanced.
#) You should see 4 icons on the 2 first rows, and 2 on the last one.
#) Container should resize itself to accomodate its new size.
