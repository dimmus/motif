 * HISTORY
 */

	This test confirms that the correct drag icon is retrieved
	from the XmeGetTexualDragIcon call.  The test is a simple
	comparison between the icon displayed in the window and the
	one produced during a drag operation.  NOTE: that the icon
	displayed in the window is only part of the entire drag icon.

#)
	Move the mouse over the icon in the window.  Press the
	middle mouse button and start a drag operation (move the mouse
	while keeping the button depressed).  The mouse pointer 
	will change into the "drag icon". Move the mouse until you can
	clearly see the drag icon.  Make sure that one of the parts is
	indeed the original icon displayed.

#)
	Release the mouse button and the icon should "snap" back to the
	starting point (a visual effect, ending up at the original icon).

C)
	 Press Exit to end the test.  
         Goodbye.
