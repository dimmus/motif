 * HISTORY
 */

	This test confirms the functionality of the XmeNavigChangeManaged
function.  This function maintains navigational consistency for a manager
widget when the children are being managed and unmanaged.

#) The test cases are run using the ExmGrid manager widget and several
buttons.

#) Each case will instruct you on what the current configuration should 
be and you will be asked to verify that the "previous" and "next" keys work
as expected.  These keys are usually bound to the left and right arrow keys.

C)	This test validates the initial operation for navigating through
the children.  You should see 6 button widgets labelled "ONE", "TWO", "THREE",
"FOUR", "FIVE" and "SIX".

#)	Please select the window and press the button labelled "ONE".
This button should now be highlighted.

#)	Press the "next" key (the right arrow key) several times and make sure
that the highlighted buttons are traversed in order (e.g. "ONE", "TWO",
"THREE", etc.)

#)	Press the "previous" key (the left arrow key) several times and 
make sure that the highlighted buttons are traversed in reverse order (e.g.
"THREE", "TWO", "ONE", " SIX", "FIVE", etc.)

#)	Make sure that no error messages are printed in the xterm window.

C)	This test checks that when some of the buttons are unmanaged the 
order is maintained.

#)	Please select the window and press the button labelled "ONE".
This button should now be highlighted.

#)	Press the "next" key (the right arrow key) several times and make sure
that the highlighted buttons are traversed in order (e.g. "ONE", "FIVE",
"SIX", etc.)

#)	Press the "previous" key (the left arrow key) several times and 
make sure that the highlighted buttons are traversed in reverse order (e.g.
"ONE", " SIX", "FIVE", "ONE", etc.)

#)	Make sure that no error messages are printed in the xterm window.

C)	This test checks that when the widgets are re-managed the
original order is maintained.

#)	Please select the window and press the button labelled "ONE".
This button should now be highlighted.

#)	Press the "next" key (the right arrow key) several times and make sure
that the highlighted buttons are traversed in order (e.g. "ONE", "TWO", 
"THREE", "FOUR", etc.)

#)	Press the "previous" key (the left arrow key) several times and 
make sure that the highlighted buttons are traversed in reverse order (e.g.
"ONE", " SIX", "FIVE", "FOUR", etc.)

#)	Make sure that no error messages are printed in the xterm window.

C)	All of the children have now been unmanaged.

#)	Make sure that no error messages are printed in the xterm window.

C)	This test checks that when the widgets are re-managed the
original order is maintained.

#)	Please select the window and press the button labelled "ONE".
This button should now be highlighted.

#)	Press the "next" key (the right arrow key) several times and make sure
that the highlighted buttons are traversed in order (e.g. "ONE", "TWO",
