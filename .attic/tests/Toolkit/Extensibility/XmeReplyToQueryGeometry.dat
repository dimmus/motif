 * HISTORY
 */

	This test confirms the functionality of the XmeReplyToQueryGeometry
	Extensibility function.  A bulletin board widget is created but will
	not require intervention for the tests.
#)
	The first case checks that when the intended geometry (calculated 
	by the parent) matches the desired geometry (requested by the child
	widget) and the parent intends to use these values.

#)	Make sure that no error messages are printed in the xterm window.

C)
	This test confirms the case when the desired geometry is the same size
	as the existing widget.

#)	Make sure that no error messages are printed in the xterm window.

C)
	This test confirms the functions response when neither of the
	previous cases happen.

#)	Make sure that no error messages are printed in the xterm window.

C)
	 Press Exit to end the test.  
         Goodbye.
E)
