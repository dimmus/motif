 * HISTORY
 */

@)  This test needs to be run automated since it requires use of the
    automation performance monitor.

@)  With the SpinBox resources, XmNinitialDelay and XmNrepeatDelay,
    set to their default values, measurements are taken for the
    following actions:

#)  The time lapsed to increment the SpinBox from its minimum
    to its maximum value.

#)  The time lapsed to decrement the SpinBox from its maximum
    to its minimum value.

@)  An output file, SpinBoxPerf.prt, is generated which lists the
    measurements taken.
