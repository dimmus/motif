#) This is the PIColormap test.

C)


#) There should now be a pushbutton displayed in a window that says
   \"TEST 1 BTN 1\". It should have red lettering on a yellow background.

#) Move the pointer into the window, the colormap for the entire screen
   should shift by 1 color value - everything should look way different.

#) Click on the \"TEST 1 BTN 1\" pushbutton.  Don't be concerned if the
   pushbutton label is all black in your particular color scheme.

C)


#) Now, there should be a second pushbutton displayed in the window that
   says \"BTN 1 TEST 2\".  This pushbutton should have yellow lettering 
   on a red background.

#) Move the pointer into the window, the colormap for the screen should
   shift by 2 color values and look different than either previous colormap.
   Again, it should look very weird.

#) Click on either pushbutton.

C)


#) There should still be both pushbuttons displayed in the window.

#) Move the pointer into the window, the colormap should not change from
   the original, standard colormap.

#) Again, click on either pushbutton.

C)

!) /* begin test for CR 5183 */
#) A control panel with 3 PushButtons should have appeared : Popup, Popdown
   and Colormap. 
#) Click MB1 on "Popup". An OverrideShell should appear.
#) Click MB1 on "Popdown". The OverrideShell should disappear.
#) Click MB1 on "Colormap".
#) Click MB1 on "Popup". The OverrideShell should reappear.
#) ClickMB1 on "Popdown". Only the OverrideShell should disappear. If
   the main shell containing the control panel disappears as well, 
   CR 5183 hasn't been fixed.
