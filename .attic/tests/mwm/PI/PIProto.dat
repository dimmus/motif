#) This is the PIProto test.

C)


#) There should be two pushbutton windows displayed.  The first should
   have a yellow background and red letters that say \"TEST 1 BTN 1\".
   The second should have a red background with yellow letters that say
   \"BTN 1 TEST 2\".

#) Pick the f.kill option (\"Close\") off the menu in the border of the 
   first window. The window should not actually close, but instead a 
   message should appear on the standard output saying 
   "Close window message sent."

C)


#) The first window should remained unchanged. The second window with
   the yellow on red background should unmap and remap. Also, you
   should see a message on the term window saying 
   "Motif Message message sent."

#) The second window with the yellow on red background should now have
   a new item on it's window menu. The new item should be labelled 
   \"Send_Message\".

#) Pick \"Send_Message\" from the menu of second window, you should
   see two messages appear on the standard output. The first should
   say "Motif Message callback hit.". The second message should say
   "Motif Message message sent."

C)


#ifdef SHOW_P899

#) The first window should remain unchanged. The second window should
   now have a second new item on it's window menu.  The newest item 
   should be labelled \"Send_Message2\".

#) Pick \"Send_Message2\" from the menu of second window, you should
   see two messages appear on the standard output.

C)

#endif SHOW_P899


#) The first window should remained unchanged. The second window should
   now have a second and a third new item on its window menu. The second
   item should be labelled \"Send_Message2\". The third item should be
   labelled \"Send_Message3\" but it should be grayed out and inaccessible.

#) If, by error, the third new item is not grayed-out, select it and see 
   two messages appear on the standard output.

#) Also, select the second new item \"Send_Message2\" again, and see
   two more messages appear on the standard output.
