#) This is the PIConfig test.

C)


#) There should be two pushbutton windows displayed.  The first should
   have a yellow background and red letters that say \"TEST 1 BTN 1\".
   The second should have a red background with yellow letters that say
   \"BTN 1 TEST 2\".

C)


#) There should be several new windows with different decorations,
   positioned in a staggered fashion, so that each of them is partially
   visible.

#) The window with no decorations should be at (200, 100).

#) Move one of the windows with title bar to 150, 150. 

C)


#) The window with just the border is moved to 250, 250.The window with 
   no min max button is moved to 400, 400. Thw window with no 
   decorations is moved to 100, 400.

#) Use xwininfo to get the positions of windows. 

#) Select Move operation for each window either through WindowMenu 
   selection or through accelerators, and compare the position shown 
   in the Feedback window with the position shown by xwininfo. 

#) If the two positions do not match for the window with no decorations,
   and they are not exactly (100, 400), then the ReConfigure bug is 
   still present.
