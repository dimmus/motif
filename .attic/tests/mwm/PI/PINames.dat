#) This is the PINames test.

C)


#) There should now be a label displayed in a window that describes the
   window's new name. The window decorations should be full except the 
   border and the resize handles.

#) There should be a second window that is solid black with full border 
   decorations and a title of \"*****\".

#) Also, there should be a window with the title \"PINames\". This
   window's decorations should be ONLY a border with a title bar in it.

C)


#) The label window should now be iconified and the name of the icon 
   should be \"PI Icon\".

#) The solid black window should now have a title of \"Second New Name\".

#) The PINames window's decorations should remain unchanged.

C)


#) The label window should have been deiconified and the label should
   describe the window's new name. This time, the label window's 
   decorations should be ONLY a title bar.

#) The solid black window should remain unchanged.

#) Again, PINames window's decorations should remain unchanged.
