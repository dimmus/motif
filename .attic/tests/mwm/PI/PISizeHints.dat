#) This is the PISizeHints test.

C)


#) There should now be a pushbutton displayed in a window that shows
   a yellow background and red letters that say \"TEST 1 BTN 1\".

#) There should also be a control panel with seven scales to specify
   different min, max, base sizes and resize increment for the
   pushbutton window. You can apply different values by clicking on
   the \"Apply\" button. The pushbutton window should be unmapped
   and remapped with new values everytime.

C)


#) The pushbutton window will be in the same state it was at the end
   of the previous screen.

#) The control panel now should contain four scales to specify 
   different minimum and maximum aspect ratio values. Again, you can
   apply different set of values by clicking on the "\Apply\" button.

C)

E)
