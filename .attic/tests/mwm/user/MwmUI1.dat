   "THIS IS JUST A TEST STRING" in 6x12 font.

#) Irrespective of whether the window was visible with the previous
   instruction panel, you should now see the same string 
   "THIS IS JUST A TEST STRING" in courb24 (courier-bold-24) font.

C)

#) Resize the window to 500x500.

#) Move the window over so as to cover the iconBox.
