#) This test routine tests the Uil translation table data structure by
   comparing a uil translation table to an equivalently defined Intrinsics
   translation table.

#) For each of the following screens the tester will apply the
   same keystrokes (or mouse events) to test both applications.

#) Two top-level shells, named \"Xt Version\" and \"Uil Version\",
   have appeared on the screen (one on top of the other).

C)

#) For each shell (\"Xt Version\" and \"Uil Version\"), click on the text 
   field and type the string \"How now brown cow\".  

#) Then click on the Change My Label button for each application.  
   The text in the text field should be copied into the pushbutton label.  

C)

#) Click on the text field of the \"Uil Version\" and type
   \"Pickled Peppers\".  Then type \"C-a\" (cntrl a).  The text
   in the text field should be copied into the pushbutton label.
   If not, CR 3281 has not been fixed.

C)

#) Click on the text field for each application and type the string \"C-b\" 
   (cntrl b).  The insertion point should move to the beginning of the text.

#) Type \"C-e\".  The insertion point should move to the end of the text.
C)

#) Move the mouse pointer to the area between the two pushbuttons.  Type
   \"C-q\".  The application window should disappear and dump the text
   to the terminal window.
C)

#) If the two applications exhibited the same behavior, then the translation
   tables must be matched.
E)
