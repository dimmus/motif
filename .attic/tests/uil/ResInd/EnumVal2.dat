#) Enumerated Values Test 2:
!) The following is a Bulletin Board set up to test correct
   usage of enumeration values. (Note: this explanation text
   itself tests the following:
	 - XmNeditMode = XmMULTI_LINE_EDIT
#)Bulletin Board characteristics:
!)	 - XmNborderWidth = 1
	 - XmNbackground =  sky_blue
	 - XmNmarginWidth =  20
	 - XmNmarginHeight =  20
	 - XmNdefaultPosition =  false
	 - XmNnoResize =  true
	 - XmNResizePolicy = XmRESIZE_GROW
	 - XmNshadowType = XmSHADOW_ETCHED_OUT
	 - XmNshadowThickness = 10
#) Label characeristics:
!)	 - XmNunitType = Xm100TH_MILLIMETERS
	 - XmNx = 1000
	 - XmNy = 1000
	 - XmNwidth = 6000
	 - XmNalignment = align_value = XmALIGNMENT_END
	 - XmNlabelString = Label 1
	 - XmNstringDirection = XmSTRING_DIRECTION_L_TO_R
#) Separator characteristics:
!)	 - XmNunitType = Xm1000TH_INCHES
	 - XmNx = 394
	 - XmNy = 900
	 - XmNwidth = 4000
	 - XmNseparatorType = XmDOUBLE_DASHED_LINE
