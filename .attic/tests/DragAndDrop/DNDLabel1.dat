#) This is the DNDLabel1 test.

#) To test this, you need to run another Motif client with an
   editable Text(Field) widget in it.

#) You should see a Label widget with two-line label.

#) Position the pointer anywhere on the Label. Initiate drag by 
   pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default).

#) With BTransfer pressed, drag the pointer over to the Text
   widget, and release BTransfer. The text \"Two-Line\" should
   appear in the Text widget at the point where the button was
   released and on the next line the text \"Label String\"
   should appear.

C)

#) This panel tests that a dragged object can be moved and a drag
   completed via the keyboard, when the drag is initiated using the default
   BTransfer action (Pressing MB2).

#) Position the pointer anywhere on the Label. Initiate drag by 
   pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default).

#) With BTransfer pressed, click on KUp. The drag icon should move
   up. Repeat with KDown, KLeft and KRight. The drag icon should move
   in the direction corresponding to the arrow key. Move the drag icon until
   the hotspot is within the Text widget, and hit KReturn.
   The text \"Two-Line\" should appear in the Text widget at the point 
   where the cursor in the Text widget  was and on the next line the 
   text \"Label String\" should appear.
#) Position the pointer anywhere on the Label. Initiate drag by 
   pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default).
#) Drag the pointer over to the Text widget. Now, hit the osfActivate key.
   The text \"Two-Line\" should appear in the Text widget at the point 
   where the cursor was in the Text widget and on the next line the 
   text \"Label String\" should appear.
C)

#) This panel tests that a drag action can be initiated via the keyboard.
#) The translations for the Label have been overridden so that BTransfer is
   now <Ctrl>d.
#) Position the pointer anywhere on the Label, and click <Ctrl>d. A drag
   action should be initiated. 
#) Click on KUp. The drag icon should move up. Repeat with KDown, KLeft and 
   KRight. The drag icon should move in the direction corresponding to the 
   arrow key. Move the icon until the hotspot is within the Text widget, 
   and hit KReturn. The text \"Two-Line\" should appear in the Text widget 
   at the point where the pointer was , and on the next line the 
   text \"Label String\" should appear.
