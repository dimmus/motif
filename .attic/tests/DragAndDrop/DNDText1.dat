#) This is the DNDText1 test.

#) This is just to test the DND support in the Text widget.

#) Enter some text in the Text widget.

#) Select some of the entered text.

#) Position the pointer on the selected text and initiate drag by
   pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default).

#) With BTransfer pressed, drag the pointer over to some other part
   of the Text widget and release BTransfer. The selected text should
   get moved from its original position to the point where BTransfer
   was released.

#) Select some text again.

#) Position the pointer on the selected text and initiate drag by
   pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default).

#) Now hold \<Ctrl\> key down and with BTransfer pressed, drag the
   pointer to some other location in the Text widget and still
   holding the \<Ctrl\> key, release BTransfer. This time, the
   selected text should get copied into the new location, meaning
   it should still be present at its original position also.
