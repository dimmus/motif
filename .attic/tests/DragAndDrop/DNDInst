Brief description of various commandline options for DND tests :
----------------------------------------------------------------

	All these options are in addition to the standard X options like
	"-display", "-xrm", etc. Note that all the options need to be
	preceded by "-u".


	1. The tests DNDLabel1, DNDList1, DNDText1, DNDTxtLbl1, DNDtest1,
	   DNDtest2, and DNDtestGad1, can be run by typing the command:

	   <test_name> [-u -noinstruct]

	   If "-u -noinstruct" is specified, the test is run without the
	   instruction panel.


	2. The tests DNDDrop1, DNDDrop2, DNDIcon1, DNDIcon2, DNDProt1,
	   can be run by typing the command:

	   <test_name> [-u "[-I init_proto] [-R receiver_proto] [-noinstruct]"]


	   where

	   (i)    init_proto is the initiatorProtocolStyle that the user can
		      specify and can any one of the following values:

		      P  - for PREREGISTER
		      D  - for DYNAMIC
		      N  - for NONE
		      DO - for DROP_ONLY
		      PD - for PREFER_DYNAMIC
		      PP - for PREFER_PREREGISTER
		      PR - for PREFER_RECEIVER

	   (ii)   receiver_proto is the receiverProtocolStyle that the user can
		      specify and can any one of the following values:

		      P  - for PREREGISTER
		      D  - for DYNAMIC
		      N  - for NONE
		      DO - for DROP_ONLY
		      PD - for PREFER_DYNAMIC
		      PP - for PREFER_PREREGISTER

		(iii) noinstruct means the test should be run without instruction
			  panel.

		For example, the command

			DNDDrop1 -u "-I PR -R D -noinstruct"

			means, the test DNDDrop1 is run without the instruction panel,
			and that the initiatorProtocolStyle specified is PREFER_RECEIVER,
			and the receiverProtocolStyle specified is DYNAMIC.


	3. Also, the test DNDDrop3 is an attempt to show non-rectangular
	   and nested dropSites. Although functionally complete, this test
	   is still being developed.
