 * HISTORY
 */
#) This is the DNDDrag test. It tests the XmNdragStartCallback XmDisplay
   resource, which can be used to disable dragging.
#) A Label should have appeared on your screen with the labelString
   "Non-draggable label".
C)

#) Move the pointer over the label, and try to initiate a drag by
   pressing BTransfer (MB2 by default). No drag action should be initiated,
   and a message should be printed on to stdout saying "Sorry, can't drag!"
E)
