.SH EXAMPLE
\*LDragSliderValue Up 97 <Ctrl> Btn2\*O

This command will generate a drag from the current location (usually
the scale's slider) upwards until the value of the scale is
97, using Button2 modified by the \*LCtrl\*O key.

Scale and a ScrollBar. In a left-to-right environment, a Scale's \*LMax\*O
is on top by default. A ScrollBar's
\*LMax\*O, however, is on the bottom by default.
