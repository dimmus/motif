 * Function:

 * Description:
 *	Draws a shadow corner (beveled) at the given location and size.
 * Input:
 *	dpy       : Display*     - the display to draw to
 *	d         : Drawable     - the drawable to use
 *	top_GC    : GC           - the GC to use to draw the top half of
 *                                 the bevel
 *	bottom_GC : GC           - the GC to use to draw the bottom half
 *                                 of the bevel
 *	x         : int          - the x location of the corner
 *	y         : int          - the y location of the corner
 *	size      : unsigned int - the size of the corner
 *                                 (width = height = size)
 *	option    : XmBevelOption- what part of the bevel should we draw.
 * Output:
 *	None.
