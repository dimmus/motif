# What is Motif?

Motif is a freely available source code distribution for the 
Motif user interface component toolkit. Motif is built on top of the 
standard X Toolkit(Xt) and X11 libraries.

## Overview of Motif

Motif 2.3.X is an updated version of Motif 2.3. 
Any applications built against a previous 2.x release of Motif will be 
binary compatible with this release.

The distribution contains the following items:

* libXm source code and include files
* Motif reference documentation (man pages)
* Utility libraries
* Demo programs

## OS Support

The following platforms are supported operating systems:

* Linux 2.6 and higher
* Solaris 10

Motif 2.3.x was built and tested on the following systems:
* Fedora 15 x86_64
* Solaris 10 sparc

In all cases, the compiler originally provided with the OS was used.

## Build and Install

To build you will need to install the following extra software:

* autoconf >= 2.69
* automake >= 1.16.1
* autopoint
* pkg-config
* GCC
* GNU Make (POSIX make is not sufficient)

And any tools that those utilities require (GNU m4, etc.)

When dependencies installed can run:

  $ ./autogen.sh
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ sudo make install

Please see the file distro/README.RPM for information on creating 
rpms from this source tree.
