#
# The various values of "memory_switch" and their meanings are as follows:
#
#     -all    - Log the complete Purify output
#     -leaks  - Log only memoryleaks
#     -fm     - Log only Freed Memory Read (Write) access errors
#     -um     - Log only Uninintialized Memory Read (Write) access errors
#     -ab     - Log only Array Bound Read (Write) access errors
#     -fu     - Log only Freed and Uninintialized Memory access errors
#     -fa     - Log only Freed and Array Bound Memory access errors
#     -ua     - Log only Uninintialized and Array Bound Memory access errors
#     -nocopy - Don't copy a .purify file in your current directory. If you 
#	        have a customized .purify in your current directory, it will 
#		use it, else it will act as -all.
