.TH DragComponent 3X
.SH NAME
\*LDragComponent \*O\(em Command to drag within a component of a widget.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\*LDragComponent\*O
\*VWidgetName Component Destination [ModifierList]* [Button]\*O
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\*LDragComponent\*O
command will drag between two subcomponents of a widget. This command
will be used in a List widget to drag between List items, and also
will be used in a Text widget to drag between text characters (to make
primary and secondary selections). This command should follow a command to
\*LLocatePointer\*O to a subcomponent where the drag
will begin. The \*LDragComponent\*O command will then cause a drag
action between the
two points, current and specified.
The \*LDragComponent\*O command is composed of a call to
\*LPressMB\*O, a call to \*LLocatePointer\*O to move to the destination,
and then a call to \*LReleaseMB\*O. The mouse button used in the drag may
be specified with optional argument \*VButton\*O.
.IP "\*VWidgetName\*O" 13n
The XtName representing the widget you wish to take an action on.
.IP "\*VComponent\*O"
Particular component within the widget. See \*LComponentList(3X)\*O for
a full list of supported components.
.IP "\*VDestination\*O"
Number correponding to the index within the component. In the case where the
component is \*VRListItem\*O, \*VDestination\*O refers to the list item
number (0 is the first element in the list). If the component is
\*VRTextChar\*O, \*VDestination\*O refers to the character position with the
Text widget (0 is the first character).
.IP "\*V[ModifierList]*\*O"
List of Modifiers to modify the mouse button press. For a full list of
available Modifiers see \*LModifierList(3X)\*O. The default is no modifiers.
.IP "\*V[Button]\*O"
Button to be pressed. For a full list of available
Buttons see \*LButtonList\*O. The default is \*LButton1\*O.
