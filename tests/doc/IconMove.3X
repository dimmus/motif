.SH SYNOPSIS
\*LIconMove\*O

.SH DESCRIPTION
The

command will move the icon window associated with the specified

of the nearest shell parent in the widget hierarchy will be used.

Otherwise, this function is executed by moving the pointer to the
middle of the icon window, and generating a Select button
press and drag until the icon window is positioned at
\*Vx, y\*O.
