.TH Wait 3X
.SH NAME
\*LWait \*O\(em Command to Wait an Automated script
.SH SYNOPSIS
\*LWait\*O
\*VSeconds\*O
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\*LWait\*O
command will wait in the current position for \*VSeconds\*O number of
seconds. The command is very usefull when scrolling in a ScrolledList or
ScrolledText widget when the widget contains a good amount of information.
Since the scrolling actions are timer based, a simple \*LDragSliderValue\*O
may not produce the desired effect. If you follow a \*LDragSliderValue\*O
with a \*LWait 10\*O then the scrolled widget should have enough time to
fully scroll through all its data. While the program is waiting, all
events will be processed.
.IP "\*VSeconds\*O" 10n
Number of seconds to wait in the current position.
.PP
For more information about \*LWait\*O, see
the \*EOSF/Motif Quality Assurance Test Suite User's Guide\*O.
.SH EXAMPLE
\*LWait 10\*O
.PP
This will cause the client to wait in its current state for 10 seconds.
