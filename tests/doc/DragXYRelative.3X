.TH DragXYRelative 3X
.SH NAME
\*LDragXYRelative \*O\(em Command to drag in Delta X, Delta Y direction
.SH SYNOPSIS
\*LDragXYRelative\*O
\*VDirection Delta1 [Delta2]\*O
.br
\*V[ModifierList]* [Button]\*O
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
\*LDragXYRelative\*O
command will drag to a coordinate location in a widget hierarchy.
The Drag will begin at the cursor's current location (see \*LLocatePointer\*O)
The destination coordinate will be determined by the parameters to this
function. Delta1 and Delta2 are changes in the X or Y direction
(depending on the value of Direction). The \*LDragXYRelative\*O command
is composed of a call to \*LPressMB\*O, a call to \*LLocatePointer\*O
to move to the second coordinate, and a call to \*LReleaseMB\*O.
.IP "\*VDirection\*O" 14n
Direction in which to Drag. Valid values are \*LUp\*O, \*LDown\*O, \*LRight\*O,
\*LLeft\*O, and
\*LAny\*O. \*LAny\*O indicates a change in both the X and Y direction.
.IP "\*VDelta1\*O"
Change in either the X or Y direction. If \*VDirection\*O is either \*LUp\*O or
\*LDown\*O then \*VDelta1\*O is used as the change in the Y direction.
If \*VDirection\*O
is \*LRight\*O, \*LLeft\*O, or \*LAny\*O, then \*VDelta1\*O
is the change in the X direction.
.IP "\*V[Delta2]\*O"
Change in the Y direction (only used if \*VDirection\*O is \*LAny\*O).
.IP "\*V[ModifierList]*\*O"
List of Modifiers to modify the mouse button press. For a full list of
available modifiers see \*LModifierList(3X)\*O. The default is no modifiers.
.IP "\*V[Button]\*O"
Button to be pressed. For a full list of available
buttons see \*LButtonList(3X)\*O. The default is Button1.
.PP
