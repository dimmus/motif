# HISTORY
#  @) A client with a vertical scale widget will appear.  There will be
#     11 label widgets (\"0\", \"10\", \"20\", \"30\", \"40\",
#     \"50\", \"60\", \"70\",
#     \"80\", \"90\", and \"100\") to left of the scale.  The labels will
#     all have small borders.  The labels will be created BEFORE the TOP
#     level shell has been realized.  This process will be very slow. 
#  #) Press and hold down MB1 on the slider and drag it up and down.
#     Verify that the value to the left of the slider corresponds to
#     the slider's position within the scale.  The value and reason
#     will be printed to the stdout window.  Release MB1.

#  #) Press MB1 in the scroll region above the slider.  Verify that the
#     value to the left of the slider corresponds to the slider's
#     position within the scale.  The value and reason will be printed
#     to the stdout window.

#  #) Resize the client larger.  The labels should spread out and
#     remain on the left side of the client window, the scroll region
#     should span the right side of the client window, and the value
#     should be to the left of the slider.

#     arrayed above it. 
#  #) Press and hold down MB1 on the slider and drag it to the right
#     and to the left.  Verify that the value above the slider
#     corresponds to the slider's position within the scale.  The value
#     and reason will be printed to the stdout window.  Release MB1.
