# HISTORY

# The following panels test the snapback scrolling feature.

# A vertical scrollbar should be displayed. The XmNsnapBackMultiple resource
# is set to its default value, which means the scrollbar slider should
# move as long as pointer is within the bounds of a reasonable screen size.
# Press MB1 on the scrollbar slider. While continuing to hold down MB1,
# move the pointer horizontally outside the bounds of the scrollbar. Continue
# to press MB1 while moving the slider in the vertical direction.
# The scrollbar slider should continue to move.
