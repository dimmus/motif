# HISTORY



#  This test should have been run with the flag "-u 5".
#  A Notebook will appear on your screen. All resources for this Notebook 
#  have been set via the defaults file Notebook.defaults. 
#  There will also be a control panel with which you can do a GetValues on
#  those resources of the Notebook that are of type Dimension. (Since it
#  may not be hard to visually gauge what values these resources have been
#  set to).
#  The orientation of the Notebook should be horizontal.
#  The placement of the back pages should top right.
#  The binding of the Notebook should be the GNU pixmap. This should be 
#  constrained by the binding width, which is 20 pixels.
