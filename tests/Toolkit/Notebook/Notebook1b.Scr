# HISTORY

#) This test should have been run with the flag "-u 2".
#) A Notebook will appear on your screen. All resources for this Notebook 
#   have been set via the defaults file Notebook.defaults. 
#   There will also be a control panel with which you can do a GetValues on
#   those resources of the Notebook that are of type Dimension. (Since it
#   may not be hard to visually gauge what values these resources have been
#   set to).
#) For this particular test, the widget called "StatusArea" has been set
#  to be a major tab. However, clicking on it should have no effect.
#) The Notebook should have vertical orientation.
#) The placement of the back pages of the Notebook should be top left.
#) The binding should be solid.
#) Click on the 'bindingWidth' PushButton. There should be a message on
#   stdout indicating that binding width is 20.
