/* This test takes all its resources from the resource file ComboBox.defaults
   in the ./tests/Toolkit/ComboBox directory. The test should be passed
   a flag (a number from 1-3), which will determine the XtName of the
   ComboBox widget created. This name then determines what resources
   are set for the ComboBox. The resource file contains 3 set of resources
   for this test */
