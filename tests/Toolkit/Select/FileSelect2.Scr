# A simple File Selection Box is created. The directory list should
# contain two items and the Files list should contain multiple file
# names.

# The purpose of this test is to modify the FileSelectionBox programatically
# The next step will add a Work area which will be a Text widget. The
# text widget will contain the string \"Some Text.\"

# The Text widget work area should have been added.
# The next step will unmanage the Files label and list. This will
# cause the FileSelectionBox to expand and the full Directory list
# should be visible.
