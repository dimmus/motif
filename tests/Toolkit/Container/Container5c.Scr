# #) The spatialStyle is changed to XmGRID, with an IncludeModel set to 
#    CLOSEST, and a SnapModel set to SNAP_TO_GRID.
# #) The Icon gadgets should slighlty move to have their top left corner
#    attached to the top left corner of the cell they occupied.
# #) So the grid you have is as follow:
# !)	       IconGad0    IconGad1    IconGad2    IconGad3
# 	       IconGad4                IconGad5
# 	                   IconGad6    IconGad7    IconGad8
