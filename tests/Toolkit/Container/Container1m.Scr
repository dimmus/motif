#    icon view, with the pixmap part displaying a "S" within
#    a black box, and the label part displaying the strings "IconGad1",
#    "IconGad2", "IconGad3" and "IconGad4" next to the pixmap. 
#    The label "IconGad2" should be truncated.
# #) "IconGad3" should be displayed in its large icon view, with the pixmap 
#    part displaying a "L" within a black box, and the label part 
#    displaying the string "IconGad3" below the pixmap.
#    There should also be visible to the left of IconGad3, a
#    pixmap displaying letter "C" with background white and foreground
#    black. This indicates that the item "IconGad3" has child items that
