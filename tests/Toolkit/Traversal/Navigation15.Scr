# HISTORY


#) Testing the XmNinitialFocus resource of a DrawingArea.

#) You should see a Form with two DrawingArea children separated by
#   a seperator.  The topmost DrawingArea has two children both of
#   which are TextFields.

Continue

#) XmNinitialFocus set to NULL for both DrawingAreas.

#) Use the KTab key to traverse around the form.

#) You should see messages printed to stdout that indicate the focus is
#   being registered by the two TextFields and DrawingArea 2 (the one on
#   the bottom.)
