# HISTORY
#!) This is a test of traversal behaviors.
#) A Bulletin Board contains a button, labeled NewerButton
#  and another bulletin board which contains Frame/Row Columns
#  with button and toggles, an arrowbutton, a single NewToggle
#  and a NewButton.  The default button is set to 3btn1.
  
#)  Check out the Tabbing behavior.  Tab should move from group
#  to group.  Note that NewButton cannot be Tabbed to.  It is 
#  within the NewToggle group and can be reached via KDown when 
#  focus is on NewToggle.  Also note that 3btn1 gets highlighted
#  whenever focus is *not* on a push button.
