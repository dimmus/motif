# HISTORY
#) The translations for the buttons and text widgets have been overridden so
#  that each time you press the TAB key, a message will be printed out saying
#  which widget currently has the focus, and in which tab group that widget is.
#  Then the focus will move to the next tab group.
#) Put the focus on several different buttons and hit tab. Verify that the
#  widget and tab group names printed out are the widget and tab groups you
#  are traversing FROM.
#) Try this also for the empty frames and the text widgets.
#) The traversal order should go from left to right, and from the top text
#  widget to the bottom one.
