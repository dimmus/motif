# HISTORY

#  A client with a form should appear. The form should
#  contain one PushButton labeled push1. 
#  Resize the client in width and height. You should
#  see a second PushButton attached to the right, left, and bottom
#  of the form and set 10 pixels from push1 border. 
#  Press MB1 on the pushButton1. A callback will set
#  PushButton2's topAttachment to XmATTACH_NONE, and set the top Widget
#  constraint to NULL. The top of PushButton2 moves up and
#  under PushButton1.
