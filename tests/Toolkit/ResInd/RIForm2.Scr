#) A client with a form should appear. The form should
#) contain one pushbutton labeled 'pushB'. 
#) Select the pushbutton several times. Selecting the pushbutton
#) will invoke a callback that will print the current width and
#) height of the pushbutton and will increase the width and height
#) of the pushbutton. The form disallows this increase, so the form
#) should not grow.
