# HISTORY

# This test tests XmNvisual

Continue

#  We try to create visuals from all six visual classes for the current 
#  display. At least one of the conversions must succeed. Any failures will
#  send a warning to stderr that can be ignored. See that the table 
#  in stdout has at least one of the entries as \"Yes\". Then, for each 
#  successful conversion, we attempt to change the value of the resource 
#  XmNvisual in the shell widget. In stdout, for each attempted change, the 
#  string \"Visual successfully modified\" must appear.
