#  Begin CR 5303 

# A bulletin board containing 4 toggle buttons is created.  The initial
# spacing (XmNspacing) is set to 4.  The purpose of the test is to make
# sure that reducing and increasing the spacing works.  This tests CR5303.

# First click MB1 on ToggleButton1.  The spacing should increase to 50.
# The spacing value for each button is printed on the calling xterm.

# Next click MB1 on ToggleButton2.  The spacing should DECREASE to 5.
# The spacing value for each button is printed on the calling xterm.   

# Next click MB1 on ToggleButton3.  The spacing should increase to 100.
# The spacing value for each button is printed on the calling xterm.

# Finally, click MB1 on ToggleButton4.  The spacing should DECREASE to 75.
# The spacing value for each button is printed on the calling xterm.

# A bulletin board containg 6 children is created, 1 ToggleButton, one
# Lable, and 4 PushButtons.  They are arranged in two rows of three.
# The top row contains the Toggle, Lable and one Pushbutton.  Clicking
# MB1 on the corresponding PushButton below will change the XmNy resource
# and move the children below the 'Move' PushButtons.  The children
# should NOT change size.  This test corresponds to CR 5163 (ToggleButton
# resizes to minimum when changing any resource).

# First click MB1 on "Move TglBtn1".  The "ToggleButton1" child should
# move below the "Move TglBtn1" PushButton but should NOT change size.

# Next, click MB1 on "Move PushBtn1".  The "PushButton1" child should
# move below the "Move PushBtn" PushButton but should NOT change size.

# Finally, click MB1 on "Move Lbl1".  The "Lable1" child should
# move below the "Move Lbl1" PushButton but should NOT change size.
