# HISTORY

# Note: seemingly random resizings (that don't reflect the instructions)
# are an attempt to return the panes to reasonable sizes after 
# resizings that obey the instructions.

#  A client with a Paned Window with three pushbuttons will appear.
#  The panes should be 100 pixels wide and 50 pixels high.
#  No constraints have been set, so all possible resizings should
#  be allowed.
#  Return the panes to reasonable sizes and continue for more testing.
