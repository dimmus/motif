# Environment configuration directory for Motif tests
# Converted from imake to autotools

# This directory contains environment configuration files
# No build targets needed, just configuration files

# Install configuration files to appropriate locations
# Note: These are typically user-specific, so we don't install them by default

# Clean up generated files
