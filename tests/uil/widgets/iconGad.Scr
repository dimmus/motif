# HISTORY

# This test should be displayed on both a color and a monochrome screen for 
# full coverage.
# Three icons appear, each in a bulletin board.
#      - in the top right corner, a white board with a pallette icon is shown.
#      - in the middle right, a yellow board with a gray and blue line pattern.
#      - in the lower left, a red board with the same pallette icon as in the 
#        first board.
#      - When displayed on a monochrome system, the two palette icons should 
#      - appear the same.
