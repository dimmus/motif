/*	Function Name: WSMSendMessage
 *	Description: Sends a message to WSM or WM on the screen
 *                   and display specified.
 *	Arguments: w - any widget on this display and screen that
 *                     also has destination callback.
 *                     Note - This widget MUST have the destination
 *                            callback set to UTMDestinationProc that
 *                            is defined in utm_send.c.
 *                 send_to - either WSMWorkspaceManager or WSMWindowManager
 *                 request - the request to send.
 *                 reply_callback - The routine to call when the
 *                                  reply comes in.
 *                 reply_data - Client data passed to the reply_callback.
 *	Returns: True if an attempt is made to retrieve the selection,
 *               False if an obvious error occured.
 *
 * NOTE: Reply callback will be called with reply == NULL if unable
 *       to convert request.
