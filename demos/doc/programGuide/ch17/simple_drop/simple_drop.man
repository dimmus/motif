.SH SYNOPSIS
.sS
\*Lsimple_drop\*O \*V<pixmap_file>\*O
.sE
.SH DESCRIPTION
\*Lsimple_drop\*O illustrates how an application can add an
\*LXmNdestinationCallback\*O to an \*LXmDrawingArea\*O widget.
.PP
You must specify the name of a \*Vpixmap_file\*O as the only
argument to \*Lsimple_drop\*O.  The specified \*Vpixmap_file\*O
will be displayed in the Label widget.
.PP
You should drag the pixmap from the Label widget and drop it in
the framed DrawingArea widget.  The application extends the
DrawingArea widget so that it can act as the destination for a
pixmap transfer.  After the pixmap has been successfully transferred,
it will be displayed inside the DrawingArea.
.PP
For details on the code, see Chapter 17 of the "OSF/Motif Programmer's
Guide."
