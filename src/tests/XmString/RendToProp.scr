# HISTORY


# @) Running RendToProp.

# #) This test creates an XmRenderTable. The function XmRenderTableCvtToProp()
# is then called to convert the XmRenderTable to a string representation.
# A non-null string should be printed to stdout.

# #) The function XmRenderTableCvtFromProp() is then called to convert
# the string representation back into an XmRenderTable.  The converted
# XmRenderTable is compared against the original XmRenderTable.
# A message will be printed to stdout indicating whether the
# function XmRenderTableCvtFromProp() passed or failed.

# C)

# E)
